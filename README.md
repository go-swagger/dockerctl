# dockerctl

`dockerctl` is a command line client for [docker](https://www.docker.com/) REST API generated by [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) using docker engine open-api specification [swagger.yaml](https://github.com/docker/engine/blob/master/api/swagger.yaml).

`dockerctl` is a showcase for [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger)'s CLI (command line tool) generation capability, and is not intended to replace [docker](https://github.com/docker/cli) native CLI.
